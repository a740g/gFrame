# gFrame
C++ class library for games and graphics demos for DOS.
This is only here for legacy and historical reasons.
If you want to use and compile it, use Turbo C++ in DOSBox.
You can do with this whatever you please.
As usual, I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk. Have fun.
